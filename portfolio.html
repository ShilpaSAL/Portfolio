        <h2>Local Shop Connect</h2>
        <p>
          A web application that enables users to purchase products from nearby local shops remotely. If a shop offers home delivery, users can opt for it during checkout. Otherwise, their order will be packed and ready for pickup at the store. This project supports local businesses by bridging the gap between physical shops and digital convenience.
